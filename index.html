        <p class="lead">There are many reasons to travel to Indonesia. A country with over 17,000 islands, 8,000 of which are inhabited, Indonesia is like 100 countries in one.
          This a land of great adventure, where dramatic landscapes of beaches and volcanos is the norm, and with a rich diversity of people, customs, cultures, animals, plants, artworks, spectacular temples and food.
          The following are five reasons why you should visit Indonesia. You probably won’t make it to all 17,000 islands in one trip, but these destinations are a good place to start!</p>

        <p>One reason to travel to Indonesia is that the country knows how to put on a cultural festival, and the International Kite Festival is one of the most vibrant of the year.
          This takes place every year in July, where teams compete with each other with giant traditional Balinese kites. However, those traveling from June through August can see the kites too. Book a cheap hotel in Sanur to catch this event.</p>

        <p>If you traveled to Indonesia in the hopes of exploring a magical fishing village, Jimbaran is the place for you.
          Hand-pick your seafood and have it prepared just for you. When it comes to accommodation, there are four-star resorts,
          though travelers looking for a truly traditional experience can book a wood house in the middle of the forest with spectacular views over Kuta Lombok Bay. There are accommodation options in spades here.</p>

          <p class="lead">Many travellers avoid Singapore because of its infamously high costs, it’s cleanliness (although we’re still not sure why that is a bad thing) and its perceived lack of attractions for tourists. 
            However, skipping Singapore on your SE Asia tour is a huge mistake! Here are ten reasons why you should include Singapore on your SE Asia itinerary.</p>

          <p>Singapore ranks up with other culturally and religiously diverse nations making it quite different from its neighbouring countries. The island has four official languages; 
             English, Tamil, Malay and Mandarin and it also celebrates the national holidays of many different religions. Visitors can enjoy culinary experiences from different countries as well as visiting many different places of worship.</p>

          <p>Another great reason for visiting Singapore is that it is one of the cleanest cities in the world. Thanks to rules about spitting and littering, Singapore is free of unpleasant smells or unsightly litter.
            Though some may accuse Singapore of being rather clinical, we think its clean streets are a real plus.</p>

         <p class="lead">Though traveling to Thailand is commonplace for Europeans, most North Americans consider it too far away and even too exotic to visit on a regular week or two-week vacation. That’s a shame​ because if you can get past the 14-plus hours on a plane, 
           Thailand is a mind-expanding vacation destination. Although it’s always better to visit if you have weeks or even a month to spare, you’ll also get plenty out of your visit if you go for just a week or 10 days. </p>

         <p>The dollar goes a long way in Thailand. There are hundreds of hotels and guesthouses available for prices that sound like America in the mid-20th century. Thai food is likewise inexpensive, and often the street food vendors, who typically sell dishes for what Americans consider pocket change, 
           offer the most delicious stuff. Want to splurge? That's even better because Thailand has some outstanding hotels and resorts, all for significantly less than you would pay back home. </p>

         <p>Whether you visit in December or May, expect warm weather and mostly clear days in Thailand. There are seasons in Thailand; they’re just a little different from the ones Americans are used to—cool, hot, and rainy.</p>
